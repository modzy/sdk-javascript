# modzyClient.submitJobFile

Submit a job with the input(s) specified as a Blob (browser) or file path (Node.js). This method is best for submitting jobs with large files, as it uploads the file in chunks.

The sources object for this method will differ if you are using a browser or Node.js environment. For Node.js you specify the file path. For the browser you pass the [File object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) directly.

```javascript
const {
  model,
  status,
  totalInputs,
  jobIdentifier,
  accessKey,
  explain,
  jobType,
  accountIdentifier,
  team,
  user,
  jobInputs,
  submittedAt,
  hoursDeleteInput,
  imageClassificationModel,
} = await modzyClient.submitJobFile({
    modelId,
    version,
    explain = false,
    sources,
  });
```

## Options

- `modelId: string`
  - The model identifier, e.g. "ed542963de"
- `version: string`
  - The modelâ€™s version number. It follows the semantic versioning format, e.g. "1.0.1"
- `explain?: boolean`
  - If the model supports explainability, setting this to `true` will return an explanation of the predictions along with the results.
- `sources: {[userInputKey: string]: { [modelInputName: string]: pathOrFile: string | File }}`
  - `sources` is an object, and each key in that object represents a set of inputs. To know how to structure your sources object, you need to know what inputs the model requires and the name of those inputs. Some models only have have one input, while others require multiple inputs. Consult the API section of the model details page to get the correct input name(s). For example, the Image Classification model takes a single input named "image", so the sources object would look like this for a Node.js app:
    ```javascript
    const sources = {
      myInput: {
        image: "./tree.jpg",
      },
    };
    ```
    If you wanted to submit multiple inputs in a single job, the sources object might look like this:
    ```javascript
    const sources = {
      "input-1": {
        image: "./tree.jpg",
      },
      "input-2": {
        image: "./car.jpg",
      },
    };
    ```
    For a browser example, see `/samples/react examples/SubmitJobFile.jsx`

## Returns

A promise that resolves to a SubmitJobResponse object

```typescript
interface SubmitJobResponse {
  model: {
    identifier: string;
    version: string;
    name: string;
  };
  status: string;
  totalInputs: number;
  jobIdentifier: string;
  accessKey: string;
  explain: boolean;
  jobType: string;
  accountIdentifier: string;
  team: {
    identifier: string;
  };
  user: {
    identifier: string;
    externalIdentifier: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    email: string;
    status: string;
  };
  jobInputs: {
    identifier: string[];
  };
  submittedAt: string;
  hoursDeleteInput: number;
  imageClassificationModel: boolean;
}
```
